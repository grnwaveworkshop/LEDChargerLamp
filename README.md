# LEDChargerLamp

Project inspired on the Lamps found in the cantina in the Book of Boba Fett series.  Contains slim USB chargers and a 12V LiFe charger for charging the batteries in my Astromech.  

Uses a ESP32 running the WLED library to control rings of 144 LEDs/m neopixel strips for the lighting effects.
